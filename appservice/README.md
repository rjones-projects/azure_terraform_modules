## App Service Plan

An App Service plan defines a set of computing resources for a web app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources.

The pricing tier (`Free`, `Shared`, `Basic`, `Standard`, `Premium`, `PremiumV2`, `PremiumV3`, `Isolated`) of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan. There are a few categories of pricing tiers:

- **Shared compute**: `Free` and `Shared`, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources cannot scale out.
- **Dedicated compute**: The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.
- **Isolated**: This tier runs dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

The **`service_paln`** object accept following keys:

| Name | Description
|--|--
kind|The kind of the App Service Plan to create. Possible values are `Windows` (also available as App), `Linux`, `elastic`(for Premium Consumption) and `FunctionApp` (for a Consumption Plan)

websockets_enabled|Should WebSockets be enabled?

### A **`cors`** block - part of `site_config` supports the following

Since App Service CORS lets you specify one set of accepted origins for all API routes and methods, you would want to use your own CORS code. See how ASP.NET Core does it at Enabling Cross-Origin Requests (CORS). Don't try to use App Service CORS and your own CORS code together.
| Name | Description
|--|--
allowed_origins|A list of origins which should be able to make cross-origin calls. `*` can be used to allow all calls.
support_credentials|Are credentials supported?

### **`ip_restriction`** and **`scm_ip_restriction`** - App Service access restrictions

By setting up access restrictions, you can define a priority-ordered allow/deny list that controls network access to your app. The list can include IP addresses or Azure Virtual Network subnets. When there are one or more entries, an implicit deny all exists at the end of the list.

The access restriction capability is implemented in the App Service front-end roles, which are upstream of the worker hosts where your code runs. Therefore, access restrictions are effectively network access-control lists (ACLs).

The ability to restrict access to your web app from an Azure virtual network is enabled by service endpoints. With service endpoints, you can restrict access to a multi-tenant service from selected subnets. It doesn't work to restrict traffic to apps that are hosted in an App Service Environment. If you're in an App Service Environment, you can control access to your app by applying IP address rules.

A `ip_restriction` or `scm_ip_restriction` block supports the following and managed by `ips_allowed`, `subnet_ids_allowed`, `service_tags_allowed`, `scm_ips_allowed`, `scm_subnet_ids_allowed`, `scm_service_tags_allowed` variables. You can specify any of these variable with valid list of strings to manage the requird access.

> If enabled, one of either ip_address, service_tag or virtual_network_subnet_id must be specified.

| Name | Description
|--|--
ip_address|The IP Address used for this IP Restriction in `CIDR` notation.
service_tag|The `Service Tag` used for this IP Restriction.
virtual_network_subnet_id|The `Virtual Network Subnet ID` used for this IP Restriction.
name|The name for this IP Restriction.
priority|The priority for this IP Restriction. Restrictions are enforced in priority order. By default, priority is set to `65000` if not specified.
action|Does this restriction `Allow` or `Deny` access for this IP range. Defaults to `Allow`.

## **`auth_settings`** - Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service

Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization capabilities (sometimes referred to as "Easy Auth"), so you can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, RESTful API, and mobile back end, and also Azure Functions.

App Service uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you.  `Microsoft Identity Platform`, `Facebook`, `Google`, `Twitter`, Any `OpenID Connect` Provider are available by default.  

This Module support `Azure Active Directory Integration` and needs following keys.

| Name | Description
|--|--
client_id|The Client ID of this relying party application. Enables OpenIDConnection authentication with Azure Active Directory.
client_secret|The Client Secret of this relying party application. If no secret is provided, implicit flow will be used.
allowed_audiences| Allowed audience values to consider when validating JSON Web Tokens issued by Azure Active Directory.

## **`backup`** - Backup and Restore feature in Azure App Service

The Backup and Restore feature in Azure App Service lets you easily create app backups manually or on a schedule. You can configure the backups to be retained up to an indefinite amount of time. You can restore the app to a snapshot of a previous state by overwriting the existing app or restoring to another app.

### What gets backed up

- App configuration
- File content
- Database connected to your app

### Requirements and restrictions

- The Backup and Restore feature requires the App Service plan to be in the `Standard`, `Premium` or `Isolated`. **`Premium`** and **`Isolated`** tiers allow a greater number of daily back ups than `Standard` tier.
- You need an Azure storage account and container in the same subscription as the app that you want to back up.
- Backups can be up to 10 GB of app and database content. If the backup size exceeds this limit, you get an error.
- Backups of TLS enabled Azure Database for MySQL is not supported.
- Backups of TLS enabled Azure Database for PostgreSQL is not supported.
- In-app MySQL databases are automatically backed up without any configuration. If you make manually settings for in-app MySQL databases, such as adding connection strings, the backups may not work correctly.
- Using a firewall enabled storage account as the destination for your backups is not supported.
- Currently, you can't use the Backup and Restore feature with the Azure App Service VNet Integration feature.
- Currently, you can't use the Backup and Restore feature with Azure storage accounts that are configured to use Private Endpoint.

> Each backup is a complete offline copy of your app, not an incremental update.

`backup` object accepct following keys:
| Name | Description
|--|--
enable_backup | condition to enable backup functionality to this module and can be enabled by setting up the variable `enable_backup = true`. Defaults to `false`
name|Specifies the name for this Backup.
enabled|Is backup enabled? Depends on `enable_backup` variable
storage_account_url|The SAS URL to a Storage Container where Backups should be saved.
frequency_interval|Sets how often the backup should be executed.
frequency_unit|Sets the unit of time for how often the backup should be executed. Possible values are `Day` or `Hour`.
retention_period_in_days|Specifies the number of days after which Backups should be deleted.
start_time|Sets when the schedule should start working

## **`connection_string`** - Configure connection strings

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core developers, setting connection strings in App Service are like setting them in `<connectionStrings>` in `Web.config`, but the values you set in App Service override the ones in `Web.config`. You can keep development settings in Web.config and SQL Database credentials safely in App Service. The same code uses your development settings when you debug locally, and it uses your production secrets when deployed to Azure.

At runtime, connection strings are available as environment variables, prefixed with the following connection types:

- SQLServer: SQLCONNSTR_
- MySQL: MYSQLCONNSTR_
- SQLAzure: SQLAZURECONNSTR_
- Custom: CUSTOMCONNSTR_
- PostgreSQL: POSTGRESQLCONNSTR_

For example, a MySql connection string named connectionstring1 can be accessed as the environment variable MYSQLCONNSTR_connectionString1.

`connection_string` object accepts following keys:

| Name | Description
|--|--
name|The name of the Connection String
type|The type of the Connection String. Possible values are `APIHub`, `Custom`, `DocDb`, `EventHub`, `MySQL`, `NotificationHub`, `PostgreSQL`, `RedisCache`, `ServiceBus`, `SQLAzure` and `SQLServer`.
value|The value for the Connection String

## **`storage_account`** - Access Azure Storage from a web app

> Azure Storage in App Service is in preview for App Service on Linux and Web App for Containers. It's not supported for production scenarios.

### Limitations

- Azure Storage in App Service supports mounting Azure Files containers (Read / Write) and Azure Blob containers (Read Only)
- Azure Storage in App Service lets you specify up to five mount points per app.
- Azure Storage mounted to an app is not accessible through App Service FTP/FTPs endpoints. Use Azure Storage Explorer.

`storage_account` object accepts following keys:

| Name | Description
|--|--
name|The name of the storage account identifier.
type|The type of storage. Possible values are AzureBlob and AzureFiles.
account_name|The name of the storage account.
share_name|The name of the file share (container name, for Blob storage).
access_key|The access key for the storage account.
mount_path|The path to mount the storage within the site's runtime environment.

## **`identity`** - managed identities for App Service

A managed identity from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) allows your app to easily access other Azure AD-protected resources such as Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets.

Your application can be granted two types of identities:

- **A system-assigned identity**is tied to your application and is deleted if your app is deleted. An app can only have one system-assigned identity.
- **A user-assigned identity** is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your app. An app can have multiple user-assigned identities.

> An application can have both system-assigned and user-assigned identities at the same time. In this case, the property would be `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`

`identity` object requires following keys:

| Name | Description
|--|--
type| Specifies the identity type of the App Service. Possible values are `SystemAssigned` (where Azure will generate a Service Principal for you), `UserAssigned` where you can specify the Service Principal IDs in the `identity_ids` field, and `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` which assigns both a system managed identity as well as the specified user assigned identities. When `type` is set to `SystemAssigned`, The assigned `principal_id` and `tenant_id` can be retrieved after the App Service has been created.
identity_ids|Specifies a list of user managed identity ids to be assigned. Required if `type` is `UserAssigned`.

## VNet Integration - Integrate app with an Azure virtual network

VNet integration gives your app access to resources in your VNet, but it doesn't grant inbound private access to your app from the VNet. Private site access refers to making an app accessible only from a private network, such as from within an Azure virtual network. VNet integration is used only to make outbound calls from your app into your VNet. This feature requires a `Standard`, `Premium`, `PremiumV2`, `PremiumV3`, or `Elastic Premium` App Service pricing tier.

This feature can be enabled by setting up `enable_vnet_integration` varaible to `true` and providing a valid `subnet_id`. The subnet must have a `service_delegation` configured for `Microsoft.Web/serverFarms`

[Example usage of App service with VNet Integration](examples/app-service-with-vnet-integration/)

## App Insights

Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for developers and DevOps professionals. Use it to monitor your live applications. It will automatically detect performance anomalies, and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. It works for apps on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python hosted on-premises, hybrid, or any public cloud. It integrates with your DevOps process, and has connection points to a variety of development tools. It can monitor and analyze telemetry from mobile apps by integrating with Visual Studio App Center.

By default, this module creates App Insight and enables monitoring integration for app service. You can also specify existing App Insight in case you want to use one. See the following table for various options to customize the experience.

| Name | Description
|--|--
application_insights_enabled| Specify the Application Insights use for this App Service. Defaults to `true`
application_insights_id| Resource ID of the existing Application Insights. Defaults to `false`
app_insights_name|The Name of the application insights if you are creating the new resource with this module.
application_insights_type|Specifies the type of Application Insights to create. Valid values are `ios` for iOS, `java` for Java web, `MobileCenter` for App Center, `Node.JS` for Node.js, `other` for General, `phone` for Windows Phone, `store` for Windows Store and `web` for ASP.NET. Defaults to `web`
retention_in_days|Specifies the retention period in days. Possible values are `30`, `60`, `90`, `120`, `180`, `270`, `365`, `550` or `730`. Defaults to `90`
disable_ip_masking|By default the real client ip is masked as `0.0.0.0` in the logs. Use this argument to disable masking and log the real client ip. Defaults to `false`

## Recommended naming and tagging conventions

Applying tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name `Environment` and the value `Production` to all the resources in production.
For recommendations on how to implement a tagging strategy, see Resource naming and tagging decision guide.

> **Important** :
Tag names are case-insensitive for operations. A tag with a tag name, regardless of the casing, is updated or retrieved. However, the resource provider might keep the casing you provide for the tag name. You'll see that casing in cost reports. **Tag values are case-sensitive.**

An effective naming convention assembles resource names by using important resource information as parts of a resource's name. For example, using these [recommended naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#example-names), a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload is named like this: `pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001`.
