# Azure Firewall Terraform Module

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.

This Terraform module quickly creates managed, cloud-based network security service Azure Firewall with network, NAT, Application rule collections and other optional features.

### Resource Group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `resource_group_name`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `create_resource_group = true`.

> [!NOTE]
> *If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## **`firewall_config`** - Azure Firewall Configuration

This object to help set up the various settings for Azure Firewall service and supports following arguments.

| Argument | Description |
|--|--|
`name`|Specifies the name of the Firewall
`sku_name`|Sku name of the Firewall. Possible values are `AZFW_Hub` and `AZFW_VNet`.
`sku_tier`|Sku tier of the Firewall. Possible values are `Premium` and `Standard`.
`dns_servers`|A list of DNS servers that the Azure Firewall will direct DNS traffic to the for name resolution.
`private_ip_ranges`| A list of SNAT private CIDR IP ranges, or the special string `IANAPrivateRanges`, which indicates Azure Firewall does not SNAT when the destination IP address is a private range per IANA RFC 1918.
`threat_intel_mode`| The operation mode for threat intelligence-based filtering. Possible values are: `Off`, `Alert`, `Deny` and `""`(empty string). Defaults to `Alert`. If `virtual_hub` configuration is specified in the module, the `threat_intel_mode` has to be explicitly set as `""`
`zones`|Specifies the availability zones in which the Azure Firewall should be created. Availability Zones can only be configured during deployment and can't modify an existing firewall to include Availability Zones.

## Firewall Rules

This module centrally create allow or deny network filtering rules by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. Azure Firewall is fully stateful, so it can distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Rules are enforced and logged across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks.

To define the firewall rules, use the input variables `firewall_application_rules`, `firewall_network_rules` and `firewall_nat_rules`.

``` hcl
module "vnet-hub" {
  source  = "../modules/vnethub"
  version = "2.1.0"

# ....omitted

  # (Optional) specify the application rules for Azure Firewall
  firewall_application_rules = [
    {
      name             = "microsoft"
      action           = "Allow"
      source_addresses = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
      target_fqdns     = ["*.microsoft.com"]
      protocol = {
        type = "Http"
        port = "80"
      }
    },
  ]

  # (Optional) specify the Network rules for Azure Firewall
  firewall_network_rules = [
    {
      name                  = "ntp"
      action                = "Allow"
      source_addresses      = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
      destination_ports     = ["123"]
      destination_addresses = ["*"]
      protocols             = ["UDP"]
    },
  ]

  # (Optional) specify the NAT rules for Azure Firewall
  # Destination address must be Firewall public IP
  firewall_nat_rules = [
    {
      name                  = "testrule"
      action                = "Dnat"
      source_addresses      = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
      destination_ports     = ["53", ]
      destination_addresses = ["fw-public"]
      translated_port       = 53
      translated_address    = "8.8.8.8"
      protocols             = ["TCP", "UDP", ]
    },
  ]

# ....omitted
}
```

## Recommended naming and tagging conventions

Applying tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name `Environment` and the value `Production` to all the resources in production.
For recommendations on how to implement a tagging strategy, see Resource naming and tagging decision guide.

>**Important** :
Tag names are case-insensitive for operations. A tag with a tag name, regardless of the casing, is updated or retrieved. However, the resource provider might keep the casing you provide for the tag name. You'll see that casing in cost reports. **Tag values are case-sensitive.**

An effective naming convention assembles resource names by using important resource information as parts of a resource's name. For example, using these [recommended naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#example-names), a public IP resource for a production SharePoint workload is named like this: `pip-sharepoint-prod-westus-001`.
